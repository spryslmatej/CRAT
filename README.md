# CRAT - CCMi Rapid Annotation Tool

## Description
This is a WPF C# project as a part of my bachelor's project at the CTU University in Prague.

Its main purpose is to serve as a tool for the [CCMi research group](https://ccmi.fit.cvut.cz/home/).

The program consists of two windows -- a main window dedicated to creating the data, and a secondary window dedicated to creating and managing templates.
